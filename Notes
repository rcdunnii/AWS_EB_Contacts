The auth.js and database.js files in config folder are encrypted before pushing to github. This is done with these scripts:
	npm encrypt_auth 
	npm encrypt database

Then the contacts folder is pushed to AWS_EB_contacts on GitHub

When pulled for edits or pushed to AWS for production these files are decrypted	:
	npm decrypt_auth 
	npm decrypt_database
